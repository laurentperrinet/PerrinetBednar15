\newcommand{\Abstract}{
Making a judgment about the semantic category of a visual scene, such as whether it contains an animal, is typically assumed to involve high-level associative brain areas. Previous explanations require progressively analyzing the scene hierarchically at increasing levels of abstraction, from edge extraction to mid-level object recognition and then object categorization. Here we show that the statistics of edge co-occurrences alone are sufficient to perform a rough yet robust (translation, scale, and rotation invariant) scene categorization. We first extracted the edges from images using a scale-space analysis coupled with a sparse coding algorithm. We then computed the ``association field'' for different categories (natural, man-made, or containing an animal) by computing the statistics of edge co-occurrences. These differed strongly, with animal images having more curved configurations. We show that this geometry alone is sufficient for categorization, and that the pattern of errors made by humans is consistent with this procedure. Because these statistics could be measured as early as the primary visual cortex, the results challenge widely held assumptions about the flow of computations in the visual system. The results also suggest new algorithms for image classification and signal processing that exploit correlations between low-level structure and the underlying semantic category.

\newcommand{\SignificanceStatement}{%
 Humans can very rapidly judge the category of an image, such as
 whether it contains an animal. Previous theories for this capability
 require hierarchical grouping of low-level edge elements into
 increasingly complex object representations. Here we show that the
 edges alone are sufficient for this judgment, if the patterns of
 co-occurrence between them are taken into account. For instance,
 images with animals tend to have contours that are more highly
 curved. These results suggest that humans could be using low-level
 statistical regularities to drive rapid but accurate high-level
 judgments, and could help improve computer vision systems.
